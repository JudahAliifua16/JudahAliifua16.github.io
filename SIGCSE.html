  	<center><p>Summary of “When Are We Gonna Have a Serious Conversation About How Unserious (and Problematic) SIGCSE Is?”</span></center>
	  <ul>
	     <li>The author expresses frustration with the peer-review process, particularly regarding the rejection of their panel proposal for the 2023 Special Interest Group in CS Education (SIGCSE) Technical Symposium. They criticize the reviews they received, highlighting issues of elitism, ignorance, and racism within the SIGCSE community. The author contends that the reviewers lacked understanding of identity-inclusive computing and marginalized perspectives. They provide a detailed breakdown of the reviewers' comments, arguing that the criticisms were unfounded and demonstrated a lack of comprehension. The author questions the integrity of the review process and calls for a more inclusive and respectful approach within the SIGCSE community.</li>

	      <li>Misinformation and inequalities within the SIGCSE community has led to a lack of protection for scholars of all backgrounds, and has limited participation in computing.</li>
	      <li>The scholarly world of computer science is dominated by a specific group of people (white people who believe they are better than everyone else), and they limit those who join their group with the use of harmful peer reviews, and are critiqued with a hidden set of rules if they are not within that elite group of white people already in computer science.</li>
	      <li>The peer review process is flawed, with a major issue stemming from bias. In the case of SIGCSE, reviewers are primarily white, privileged individuals. When reviewing a piece of work that doesn’t fit within their own “group”, they will use bias and review harder than pieces of work that fit within their own “group”. </li>
