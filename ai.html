	  <ul>
	     <li>
		Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly integral in various aspects of modern life, from ad recommendations to market predictions to aiding in the education and employment of neurodivergent individuals. Neurodiversity refers to natural differences in brain wiring, encompassing conditions like autism and ADHD, which can present challenges in traditional educational and workplace settings. However, AI tools like InnerVoice by iTherapy are helping neurodivergent children in classrooms by using image-to-speech technology to aid in speech development and comprehension. Similarly, AI-powered summarization tools, such as those developed by Salesforce, assist neurodiverse individuals in processing large volumes of information by condensing it into more manageable formats.
